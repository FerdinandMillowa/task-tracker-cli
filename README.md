Task Tracker CLI
A simple Command Line Interface (CLI) tool to manage your daily tasks. This project was built as part of my Backend Development Learning Journey, following the structured path provided by roadmap.sh.

🎯 About This Project
This is my first project in a series of backend challenges. The goal was to master the fundamentals of:

Python CLI logic: Handling user input via sys.argv.

Persistent Storage: Managing data using a local JSON file.

CRUD Operations: Implementing Create, Read, Update, and Delete logic without external libraries.

Time Management: Automating timestamps for task creation and updates.

🚀 Features
Add new tasks with a description.

Update existing tasks by ID.

Delete tasks when they are no longer needed.

Mark Status as todo, in-progress, or done.

Filter lists by status to see what needs your attention.
